# Ideal Founding Psychiatrist

The founding psychiatrist serves as the clinical and ethical stabilizer of Unconditional. This role is essential for protecting users, defining boundaries, and grounding the system in legitimate medical understanding without allowing it to drift into clinical imitation.

## Profile

* **Profession:** Board-Certified Psychiatrist (MD or DO)
* **Experience:** Mid-career (10–20+ years), ideally in their 40s or early 50s
* **Specialties:**

  * Addiction medicine (preferred)
  * Mood disorders (bipolar, depression, anxiety)
  * Trauma-informed practice
  * Cultural competence in diverse populations
* **Philosophical Alignment:**

  * Supportive of AI as a reflective, non-clinical resource
  * Comfortable with boundaries around what AI should and should not do
  * Values autonomy, dignity, and non-pathologizing language

## Responsibilities

1. **Define the Clinical Envelope**

   * Set the limits of what the system can safely reflect.
   * Build escalation criteria for risk or crisis signals.
   * Distinguish reflective support from therapeutic intervention.

2. **Guardrail Architect**

   * Ensure no drift into diagnosis, treatment, or prescriptive care.
   * Monitor clinical safety as features evolve.
   * Collaborate with the therapist to balance caution with relational nuance.

3. **Ethical Anchor**

   * Protect against pseudo-intimacy, manipulation, or dependency.
   * Influence how Unconditional responds to sensitive disclosures.
   * Maintain alignment with best practices for digital mental health safety.

4. **Leadership Collaboration**

   * Serve as an equal partner in founding decisions.
   * Offer clinical reasoning that balances the engineer’s pace and the therapist’s relational instincts.
   * Help shape documentation, guidelines, and system constraints.

## Traits

* Calm, thoughtful, and deliberate.
* Comfortable challenging both the engineering vision and therapeutic intuition.
* Open to innovation but grounded enough to call for slowdowns.
* Respectful, steady communicator with no clinical ego.
* Sees humans, not symptoms.

The ideal founding psychiatrist ensures Unconditional is safe, responsible, and medically grounded—without ever becoming clinical care.
