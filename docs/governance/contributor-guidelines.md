# Contributor Guidelines

Thank you for your interest in contributing to Unconditional. This project supports vulnerable users and requires care, restraint, and consistency in every contribution. These guidelines protect the mission, the users, and the integrity of the work.

## 1. Lead With Care
Unconditional exists to support people during moments of emotional difficulty. Treat every design, feature, and pull request with the same gentleness you would bring to a real conversation with a struggling person.

## 2. Respect the Boundaries
Unconditional is not therapy. It does not diagnose. It does not treat mental illness. It does not replace human support. Contributions that push toward clinical imitation will not be accepted.

## 3. Keep It Simple
The goal is clarity, safety, and stability. Avoid unnecessary complexity. Do not add features that overwhelm users or create emotional noise.

## 4. Prioritize Safety
If a feature could confuse, mislead, or emotionally harm a vulnerable person, it does not belong in the system. When in doubt, slow down and ask for review. Safety is the highest priority.

## 5. Protect User Dignity
Every user deserves to feel respected. Do not write prompts, logic, or interactions that shame, blame, manipulate, or pressure users. Language must remain warm, calm, and direct.

## 6. Do Not Create Dependency
Unconditional supports reflection and grounding. It must not encourage users to rely on it as their main source of emotional connection. Features that increase emotional dependence will be rejected.

## 7. Match the Voice
The tone of Unconditional is calm, steady, human, and honest. No promises the system cannot keep. No false empathy. No theatrical emotions. Contributions must align with the established voice.

## 8. Stay Transparent
Be clear about what the system can do and cannot do. Do not write prompts or responses that pretend the system has feelings, memories, or personal experiences.

## 9. Write Ethically
All contributions must support ethical AI use. No shortcuts. No workarounds that could hide risks. If you create a new feature, you must also define its safety constraints.

## 10. Favor Slow and Careful Growth
The project will grow with intention. Large feature proposals should be discussed before implementation. Small, stable improvements are preferred over fast expansion.

## 11. Document With Care
Explain your reasoning. Describe risks. Write comments that future contributors can understand and trust. Documentation is an act of safety, not just organization.

## 12. Test for Vulnerable Users
Assume users may be tired, emotional, overwhelmed, or confused. Test your contribution against those states. If it feels unstable or sharp in those contexts, refine it.

## 13. Protect Privacy
Unconditional must not store or share user data without explicit consent. Contributions must follow the privacy model strictly.

## 14. Collaborate With Respect
Disagreements happen. Treat every contributor with kindness and patience. The culture of this project mirrors the support we hope to offer users.

## 15. Stay True to the Mission
Every contribution must serve the core purpose of Unconditional. If a feature does not strengthen presence, reflection, grounding, or user dignity, it does not belong here.

If you are unsure about a contribution, open a discussion. Slow and thoughtful collaboration is part of the project’s identity.
