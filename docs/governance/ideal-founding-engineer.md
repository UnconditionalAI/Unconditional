# Ideal Founding Engineer

The founding engineer is the creator, architect, and philosophical core of Unconditional. This role defines the system’s structure, voice, safety model, and long-term direction. The engineer builds not only the technology, but the conceptual foundation that allows the project to exist with clarity, intention, and restraint.

This role belongs to someone who understands both the power and the limits of AI, who has lived experience with mental health challenges, and who approaches the work with humility, intensity, and responsibility.

## Profile

* **Profession:** Staff-level (or higher) Software Engineer

## Responsibilities

1. **Architect of the System**

   * Establish safety layers, constraints, and escalation pathways.
   * Maintain a clear separation between reflection and intervention.

2. **Keeper of the Philosophy**

   * Preserve the original mission.
   * Ensure every feature aligns with presence, dignity, boundaries, and clarity.
   * Prevent scope creep into therapy, diagnosis, or pseudo-intimacy.
   * Document principles so contributors understand the emotional weight of the work.

3. **Technical Leader**

   * Set engineering standards for stability, safety, transparency, and simplicity.
   * Write clear, maintainable code.
   * Review contributions with care and calm reasoning.
   * Favor slow, thoughtful evolution of the system.

4. **Collaborative Partner**

   * Work with the psychiatrist to define clinical limits.
   * Work with the therapist to shape emotional tone and pacing.
   * Balance innovation with restraint.
   * Bring engineering clarity to discussions about human risk.

5. **Ethical Steward**

   * Protect users from harm, dependency, confusion, or emotional overreach.
   * Keep the system honest about what it is and what it cannot be.
   * Ensure AI language never pretends at memory, emotion, or personhood.
   * Treat vulnerability as sacred.

## Traits

* Intense, creative, deeply reflective.
* Emotionally honest and willing to slow down when needed.
* Comfortable with responsibility and ambiguity.
* Able to build quickly, but respectful of the need for safety and caution.
* Transparent communicator.
* Sensitive to the lived experience of mental health challenges.
* Driven by compassion, not ego.

## Why This Role Matters

The founding engineer shapes everything:

* how the system listens
* how it reflects
* how it responds
* how it stays within ethical boundaries
* how it grows
* how it stays human without pretending to be human

This role ensures that Unconditional is not another tech product, but a responsible, emotionally grounded companion built with meaning, restraint, and integrity.

The founding engineer is the architect of the possibility.
The psychiatrist is the guardian of safety.
The therapist is the guardian of humanity.

Together, they form a stable foundation.
Unconditional can only exist with all three.
