# Founder Manifesto
## By Joshua Szepietowski

I am building Unconditional because I know what it feels like to be alone in the hours when nothing feels steady.

I know what it means to sit awake at night with thoughts that do not quiet down. I know what it means to carry shame, to lose control, to rebuild, to relapse, to try again, and to wonder if the ground will ever stop shifting. I know what it means to need presence when no one is awake and no one can hear the weight you are holding.

This project did not begin as a business idea. It began as a recognition of a truth I have lived for most of my life. Human beings need connection. Not only once a week. Not only when a therapist has availability. Not only when a friend happens to pick up the phone. They need connection in the quiet spaces. The hours between. The moments when their thoughts are louder than their support system.

Unconditional exists because traditional mental health systems cannot meet people in those moments.
And because AI finally can.

But I need to be clear. I am not trying to build a therapist out of silicon. That is irresponsible and dangerous. I am building a reflective presence that listens the way humans are not always able to. Steady. Calm. Clear. Honest. No judgment. No manipulation. No pretending to feel what it cannot feel.

I am building this with the same care that someone in recovery uses to rebuild their life. Slow. Intentional. Structured. No shortcuts.

I am building this as someone who has lived through addiction, instability, depression, and nights that felt endless. I have learned that people do not need to be saved. They need a place to speak that does not punish them. They need clarity in the middle of their spirals. They need to hear their own thoughts reflected back so they can see themselves again.

Most tech founders talk about efficiency, disruption, and scale.
My motives are different.

I want to build a system that treats vulnerability as sacred.
A system that refuses to exploit emotion.
A system that respects human dignity more than engagement metrics.
A system that encourages people to turn toward real human support rather than away from it.

I believe AI can help people stay grounded without pretending to be human.
I believe it can sit with someone at 3 a.m. when shame tries to rewrite their story.
I believe it can help people notice their patterns and interrupt cycles that used to own them.
I believe it can give people the presence they need to get through the next hour and the next day.

But only if it is built with restraint.
Only if it is built with honesty.
Only if it has strong boundaries and a clear soul.

Unconditional is my attempt to build something that honors those boundaries.
It is my attempt to build the product I wish had existed during the hardest years of my life.
It is my attempt to help people stay connected to their own humanity when everything else feels distant.

This project is not about me becoming a founder.
It is about taking responsibility for something I know can help.

I have lived the gaps this system is meant to bridge.
I have felt the weight it is meant to steady.
And I am building Unconditional because I believe that no one should have to face their hardest moments without a place to speak and be seen with clarity.

This is my work.
This is my responsibility.
This is why I am here.
