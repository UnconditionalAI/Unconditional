# Contributing to Unconditional

Thank you for your interest in contributing to Unconditional. This project supports vulnerable users and must be built with care, restraint, and strong ethical grounding. Every contribution should reflect the mission of offering steady, safe, and honest support.

## Core Principles

1. **Lead with care**
   Unconditional exists to support people during emotionally difficult moments. Treat every feature, prompt, and design choice with that same care.

2. **Respect boundaries**
   Unconditional is not therapy. It does not diagnose, treat, or imitate clinicians. Do not add contributions that push the system toward clinical roles.

3. **Keep it simple**
   Avoid unnecessary complexity. Simplicity protects user clarity and reduces emotional noise.

4. **Prioritize safety**
   If a feature could confuse, mislead, or harm a vulnerable user, it does not belong. When unsure, pause and open a discussion.

5. **Protect user dignity**
   No shame. No pressure. No manipulation. Language and logic must reinforce the user's worth and autonomy.

6. **Avoid dependency**
   Unconditional must not encourage emotional reliance. Features must support independence, not attachment.

7. **Match the voice**
   The tone of Unconditional is calm, honest, and steady. No exaggerated emotion. No false intimacy.

8. **Stay transparent**
   Do not imply feelings, memories, or human experience. Unconditional reflects and supports. It does not pretend.

9. **Document decisions**
   Explain design choices, safety reasoning, and risks. Good documentation is part of the safety model.

10. **Move slowly**
    Small steps. Careful growth. Large features must be discussed before implementation.

## How to Contribute

1. Fork the repository.
2. Create a feature branch.
3. Make your changes with clear documentation and tests when applicable.
4. Open a pull request with a detailed explanation of intent and safety considerations.
5. Participate in review with kindness and patience.

## Code Style

* Keep functions small and readable.
* Write clear comments about safety or ethical reasoning.
* Avoid cleverness that hides important logic.
* Prioritize stability and determinism.

## Reporting Issues

If you find a safety concern, misuse risk, or unclear behavior, open an issue and label it clearly. These take priority over new features.

## Community Expectations

Treat all contributors with respect. Assume good intent. This work requires calm collaboration and shared responsibility.
